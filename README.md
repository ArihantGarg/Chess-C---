# Chess Program in C++

This repository contains a simple command-line based chess program implemented in C++. The program allows two players to play against each other using standard algebraic notation (SAN) for moves. It supports all basic chess rules, including castling, en passant, and auto-promotion of pawns to queens.

## How to Play

1. The program displays the chessboard, and each piece is represented using Unicode chess symbols.
2. The white player starts first, and the program prompts for input in the format "s1 s2", where s1 is the starting square and s2 is the destination square (e.g., "e2 e4").
3. The game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Basic chess rules, including castling and en passant.
- Unicode chess symbols for a visually appealing display.
- Detects check and checkmate situations.
- Handles invalid moves and prompts for re-entry.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the repository directory.
3. Compile the C++ source code using your preferred C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
